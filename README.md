# Real-world example of an infected machine

We only know the machine was infected with an APT campaign that is using HTTP C2C servers to exfiltrate data. The following PCAP is provided to you: `suspicious_traffic.pcap`

Your mission, should you choose to accept it, is to do analyze the provided PCAP file and find the APT family the machine was infected with.

In order to do this you need to:

* Get a list of all unique DNS requests generated by infected machine (IP address `192.168.19.206`)
* Compare the list of TLDs with Alexa's TOP 1 Million domains (we kind-of expect all domains in Alexa TOP 1M to be 'clean'). You can find the list here: `http://s3.amazonaws.com/alexa-static/top-1m.csv.zip`
* `diff` the 2 lists and identify the malicious domain(s)!
* Bonusu points: find out the name of the APT campaign
